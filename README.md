Hi there! I am a sophomore at Penn State University in the Enterprise Technology Integration major. This repository represents past projects I have worked on throughout my personal and educational career. "ASG" files are large class projects and are done in Java. These files have GUI elements created in the Model-View-Controller method. The files are separated out of their respective packages for easy viewing. Some entry level python work is also represented in the repo.

- asg5 is a Java project that represents understanding of abstract data types, namely queues.
- img_viewer.py is a intro project into the world of Python GUI design as well as accessing files on the local machine.
- AllergyAppProto is a presentation containing a wireframe of my first design project, an app used to track food allergies between restaurants. The files are in JPEG form for esy viewing.
- asg-4 is an in-class Java project that shows introductory skills in inheritance and data storage. This is my first project using MVC app design.
- sllPrac is a Java practice project demonstrating knowledge in abstract data types, more specifically, Singly Linked Lists.
- SustainaBowl is a Figma project that demonstrates my wireframing skills.
- IST261_Semester_Project is a studio class assignment showcasing my skills with the MVC structure, as well as API calls and basic UI design. This project also represents my skills with data persistance.
